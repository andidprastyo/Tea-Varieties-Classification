# Tea Varieties Classification

The objective of this data science project is to classify different variants of tea based on gas sensor readings collected from a sensor chamber. The dataset includes readings from four different gas sensors (MQ3, MQ4, MQ5, MQ135) for various tea variants such as Oolong tea, Hitam tea, and Hijau tea. The goal is to visualize the dataset and build a machine learning model to classify the tea variants.

Dataset Information
The dataset contains the following columns:

TEH: The type of tea (e.g., OOLONG, HITAM, HIJAU).
MQ3: Gas sensor reading from MQ3.
MQ4: Gas sensor reading from MQ4.
MQ5: Gas sensor reading from MQ5.
MQ135: Gas sensor reading from MQ135.
